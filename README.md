## Project Name
Task-Manager App

A simple Task Manager App that saves your tasks to the browser's local storage.
I wanted to add an option to edit the tasks, because as we all know, sometimes a task needs to be modified.

## Reflection
I like experimenting with different types of React applications. I used Context API and React Hooks to create this app.
Then, I invested a bit more time in the design to make the app feel interactive and responsive using CSS3 animations.
